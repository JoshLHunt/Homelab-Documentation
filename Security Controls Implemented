## Security Controls Implemented

The lab environment incorporates layered security controls to simulate enterprise best practices:

- VLAN-based segmentation between compute, storage, and service tiers
- Hypervisor-level internal bridge isolation for AD testing
- Controlled dual-homing for attack simulation realism
- Firewall-enforced routing boundaries
- Separation of storage traffic from application workloads
- Principle of least privilege within AD test environment

This design allows safe simulation of offensive techniques while preserving infrastructure integrity.
